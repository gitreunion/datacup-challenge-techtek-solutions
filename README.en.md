# La Réunion DataCup Challenge 2024 - TechTek Solutions

The [Réunion DataCup Challenge](https://data.regionreunion.com/p/page-reunion-datacup-challenge) is a unique event where all data manipulation skills are highlighted: extraction, processing, modeling, etc. Supported by the Réunion Region, *La Réunion DataCup Challenge* is part of a framework of cooperation with data producers in the territory wishing to open, share and enhance their data. The themes of the partners are varied: from the preservation of resources to the economy, or the concerns of local authorities and their inhabitants.

The objective of this second edition is to continue to unite a community around the territory's open data as well as initiate sustainable projects that are useful to as many people as possible.

## TechTek Solutions

Our team has chosen to respond to the challenge on the public procurement observatory supported by La Réunion Développement.

This challenge is intended to support territorial development and strengthen the competitiveness of businesses. The centralization and organization of data related to public procurement on a single platform is essential. This platform would serve as an information hub, facilitating transparency and access to data on public procurement, both current and future, and would allow an in-depth analysis of previous consultations.

Its objective is to group all calls for tender on a single platform in order to make information on public procurement more accessible, thus encouraging local businesses to participate more and stimulating competitiveness in the territory.

## **Documentation**

Our solution addresses the problem of the lack of access to calls for tender by businesses, which causes a lack of participation in the local market and reduces competitiveness. It consists of listing all calls for tender in Reunion Island via Boamp mainly by placing them on a map, making visualization more pleasant and access to calls for tender close to businesses easier. This solution is intended for local companies wishing to participate in calls for tenders in Reunion.
